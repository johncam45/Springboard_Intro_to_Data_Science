###########################################
## Exercise 1: least squares regression
###########################################
##   Use the /states.rds/ data set. Fit a model predicting energy consumed
##   per capita (energy) from the percentage of residents living in
##   metropolitan areas (metro). Be sure to:
##
##   1. Examine/plot the data before fitting the model
##   2. Print and interpret the model `summary'
##   3. `plot' the model to look for deviations from modeling assumptions
###########################################
## Exercise 2: interactions and factors
###########################################
##   Use the states data set.
##
##   1. Add on to the regression equation that you created in exercise 1 by
##      generating an interaction term and testing the interaction.
##   2. Try adding region to the model. Are there significant differences
##      across the four regions?
