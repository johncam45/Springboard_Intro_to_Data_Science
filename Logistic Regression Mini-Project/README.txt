## Exercise: logistic regression
################################################################
##   Use the NH11 data set that we loaded earlier.
##
##   1. Use glm to conduct a logistic regression to predict ever worked
##      (everwrk) using age (age_p) and marital status (r_maritl).
##   2. Predict the probability of working for each level of marital
##      status.
##
##   Note that the data is not perfectly clean and ready to be modeled. You
##   will need to clean up at least some of the variables before fitting
##   the model.
